App BackStory:-

> Once you make a free account on Medium, Medium readers can only read a limited amount of locked stories per month.
> <br/> <br/>
> Medium allows you to read 3 locked stories for free per month as a sort of kind gesture, but after that they lock your profile down (if you’re not a member) and you can’t read more than a few paragraphs of any locked story afterwards.
> <br/> <br/>
> So the Medium reading limit is just three locked stories.

This app is a **simple fun side-project** developed to view the Medium blogs any number of times of any user.

Highlights (few expected to be built):-

- View the Medium blogs of any user any number of times with their username's

- User using this app can mark favorite blogs and read them later

- Share the specific blog with any user
